# Module 17 Supervised Machine Learning
## Challenge: Credit Risk Analysis
### Background
The assignment states that "Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, weâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes." To solve this challenge, we are asked you to use imbalanced-learn, imblearned and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
For this project, we have been asked to use a dataset from from LendingClub.
We will use technologies such as VS Code's rendition of Jupyter notebook, IPython to mine the dataset and run it through the required models.<br/>
### Actions and Results<br/>
#### Actions: resampling
The data we are using show that there are 68470 low-risk loans and 347 high-risk ones. Our next step has been to split our data into Training and Testing sets and initiated 'oversampling it'.

||pre|rec|spe|f1|geo|iba|sup|
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|high_risk|0.01|0.73|0.57|0.02|0.64|0.42|101|
|low_risk|1.00|0.57|0.73|0.72|0.64|0.41|17104|
|avg/total|0.99|0.57|0.73|0.72|0.64|0.41|17205|

The precision for the low-risk loans is high suggesting that there may exist a positive bias towards the low-risks loans. In addition, the balanced accuracy at 0.65 is a low given the inherent bias towards low-risk loans. Another method may yield different results or confirm the bias that we've identified. Let see what results we get when retraining the data with SMOTE oversampling.
||pre|rec|spe|f1|geo|iba|sup|
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|high_risk|0.01|0.63|0.68|0.02|0.66|0.43|101|
|low_risk|1.00|0.68|0.63|0.81|0.66|0.44|17104|
|avg/total|0.99|0.68|0.63|0.81|0.66|0.44|17205|

We also tried undersampling and finally combined over and undersampling. The result for this last attempt is below. 
There isn't a drastic changes as the accuracy score for this step is at 0.64.

||pre|rec|spe|f1|geo|iba|sup|
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|high_risk|0.01|0.69|0.40|0.01|0.52|0.28|101|
|low_risk|1.00|0.40|0.69|0.57|0.52|0.27|17104|
|avg / total|0.99|0.40|0.69|0.56|0.52|0.27|17205|

### Summary
Using the Balanced Random Classifier yielded better results as the accuracy score for this model yielded a 87% accuracy percentage. The AdaBoost qualifier however offered an accuracy score of 62%.
